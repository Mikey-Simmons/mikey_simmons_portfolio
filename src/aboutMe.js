      <p className="about" >I am a passionate web developer who loves learning new technologies and implementing them into real world solutions.  I am proficient in MERN, Python, and Java.   My curiosity has driven me to become a lifelong learner.    I started and finished an extremely difficult 14 week coding boot camp called Coding Dojo in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Although it was challenging, I proved to myself that I can strive under extremely difficult circumstances and I gained an insane amount of technical knowledge.  Having previously worked in sales, 
        I love to work with people and prefer working in a team like environment.
